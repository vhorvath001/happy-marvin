I need a 'GWT-server' 'Java' component in the project 'tlem-validation-failures-report'. The name is 'GetCustomer'. The folder is 'src/main/java/com/acme/client/gwt'. Please add a method to the component: 'String getCustomerName(String id)'. put the client async interface to 'src/main/java/com/acme/client/gwt/client'. The client interface should be generated into 'src/main/java/com/acme/client/gwt/client' folder.
