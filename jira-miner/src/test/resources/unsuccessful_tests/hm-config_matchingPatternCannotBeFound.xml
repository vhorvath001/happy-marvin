<!-- in the simplified pattern the characters '[' , ']' are not allowed!!! so the '\[' and '\]' cannot be used! -->
<!-- other not allowed characters: (,),{,} 
TODO examine later how to make them use -->

<!-- 
this is not true at the moment: The next characters can be used in the values (in the sentence in the JIRA ticket) if the value is not put between apostrophes (e.g. see method)  : a-z , A-Z , 0-9 , - , _ , :
I decided other way -> all the values must be between apostrophes!!! however still only the characters below can be used -> maybe later I should
   think of changing this rule (as it seem too strict) but at this moment it is needed (see UndergroundMiningTest_sentences_successful.testMine_case1)
