The following templates exist in the application currently:

  * Java
    * POJO
    * JSR303Validator
    * stateless-EJB
    * GWT-server
    * GWT-full
    * Spring-POJO
    * Struts
  * OSB (Oracle Service Bus)
    * Proxy\_with\_facade
    * Proxy
  * Oracle-BPEL

However I'd be more than happy to help to create new templates! If you'd need a new one and you need help then please write an email to ric.flair.wcw@gmail.com .
